\n
1. Introduction\n
\n
\n
1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as the \"SDK\" and specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons) is licensed to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement forms a legally binding contract between you and Google in relation to your use of the SDK.\n
\n
1.2 \"Android\" means the Android software stack for devices, as made available under the Android Open Source Project, which is located at the following URL: http://source.android.com/, as updated from time to time.\n
\n
1.3 A \"compatible implementation\" means any Android device that (i) complies with the Android Compatibility Definition document, which can be found at the Android compatibility website (http://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be updated from time to time; and (ii) successfully passes the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS).\n
\n
1.4 \"Google\" means Google LLC, a Delaware corporation with principal place of business at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.\n
\n
\n
2. Accepting this License Agreement\n
\n
\n
2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may not use the SDK if you do not accept the License Agreement.\n
\n
2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement.\n
\n
2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a person barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other countries, including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the SDK.\n
\n
2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your employer or other entity.\n
\n
\n
3. SDK License from Google\n
\n
\n
3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK solely to develop applications for compatible implementations of Android.\n
\n
3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of course free to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible implementations of Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.\n
\n
3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law, trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not expressly granted to you.\n
\n
3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License Agreement.  Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK.\n
\n
3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an open source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software license and not the License Agreement.\n
\n
3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change without prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to users generally at Google\'s sole discretion, without prior notice to you.\n
\n
3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google\'s trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.\n
\n
3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the SDK.\n
\n
\n
4. Use of the SDK by You\n
\n
\n
4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors) under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications.\n
\n
4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).\n
\n
4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use that information to access the user\'s Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so.\n
\n
4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.\n
\n
4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.\n
\n
4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement, any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third party may suffer) of any such breach.\n
\n
\n
5. Your Developer Credentials\n
\n
\n
5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that you will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer credentials.\n
\n
\n
6. Privacy and Information\n
\n
\n
6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the information will not be collected.\n
\n
6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in accordance with Google\'s Privacy Policy.\n
\n
\n
7. Third Party Applications\n
\n
\n
7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data, content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those third party applications, data, content, or resources.\n
\n
7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to do so by the relevant owners.\n
\n
7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third parties.\n
\n
\n
8. Using Android APIs\n
\n
\n
8.1 Google Data APIs\n
\n
8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part) unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.\n
\n
8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user\'s data from Google, you acknowledge and agree that you shall retrieve data only with the user\'s explicit consent and only when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so.\n
\n
\n
9. Terminating this License Agreement\n
\n
\n
9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as set out below.\n
\n
9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the SDK and any relevant developer credentials.\n
\n
9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:\n
(A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or\n
(B) Google is required to do so by law; or\n
(C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you has terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the SDK to you; or\n
(D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of the SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google\'s sole discretion, no longer commercially viable.\n
\n
9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7 shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.\n
\n
\n
10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES\n
\n
\n
10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND \"AS AVAILABLE\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM GOOGLE.\n
\n
10.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE.\n
\n
10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.\n
\n
\n
11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY\n
\n
\n
11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY YOU, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.\n
\n
\n
12. Indemnification\n
\n
\n
12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you develop on the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress, patent or other intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or violates their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any non-compliance by you with the License Agreement.\n
\n
\n
13. Changes to the License Agreement\n
\n
\n
13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions of the SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement available on the website where the SDK is made available.\n
\n
\n
14. General Legal Terms\n
\n
\n
14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and Google in relation to the SDK.\n
\n
14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google\'s rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.\n
\n
14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The remaining provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.\n
\n
14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement.\n
\n
14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS. YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE.\n
\n
14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the License Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party.\n
\n
14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement, shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.\n

      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a\n
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work\n
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).\n
\n
      \"Derivative Works\" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object\n
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the\n
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications\n
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes\n
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain\n

      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\n
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\n
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\n
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n
      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n
\n
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n
      meet the following conditions:\n
\n
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n
\n
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n
          stating that You changed the files; and\n
\n
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n
          the Derivative Works; and\n
\n
      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n
          as modifying the License.\n
\n
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n
      the conditions stated in this License.\n
\n
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n
\n
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n
\n
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n
\n
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n
\n
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n

      source, and configuration files.\n
\n
      \"Object\" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical\n
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but\n
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,\n
      and conversions to other media types.\n
\n
      \"Work\" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or\n
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a\n
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work\n
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).\n
\n
      \"Derivative Works\" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object\n
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the\n
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications\n
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes\n
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain\n
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,\n
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.\n
\n
      \"Contribution\" shall mean any work of authorship, including\n
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions\n
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally\n
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner\n
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of\n
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, \"submitted\"\n
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent\n
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to\n
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,\n
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the\n

\n
      \"Contributor\" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity\n
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and\n
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.\n
\n
   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\n
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\n
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,\n
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the\n
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.\n
\n
   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\n
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n

      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,\n
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\n
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\n
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\n
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\n
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\n
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n
      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n
\n
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n
      meet the following conditions:\n
\n
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n
\n
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n
          stating that You changed the files; and\n
\n
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n
          the Derivative Works; and\n
\n
      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n
          as modifying the License.\n
\n
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n
      the conditions stated in this License.\n
\n
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n
\n
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n
\n
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n
\n
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n
\n
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n

\n
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n
\n
This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.\n
\n
0. Additional Definitions.\n
As used herein, \"this License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the \"GNU GPL\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n
\n
\"The Library\" refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\n
\n
An \"Application\" is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.\n
\n
A \"Combined Work\" is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked Version\".\n
\n
The \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n
\n
The \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n
\n
1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n
You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n
\n
2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n
If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:\n
\n
·         a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n
·         b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.\n
3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n
The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n
\n
·         a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.\n
·         b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n
4. Combined Works.\n
You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:\n
\n
·         a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.\n
·         b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n
·         c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n
·         d) Do one of the following:\n
o    0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.\n
o    1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user\'s computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.\n
·         e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n
5. Combined Libraries.\n
You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:\n
\n
·         a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.\n
·         b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n
6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n
\n
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n
\n
If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy\'s public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.</string>
